# PAN as a Single GCE Instance

This example showcases deploying a PAN device as a standalone GCE Intance with a Management network, an Untrust network, a trust network for web traffic and a trust network for DB traffic. Terraform handles creating the GCS bucket used for bootstrapping and populates the respective directories with content. In this sample the content is mapped to a static ./assets directory. 

## Requirements
* TF v0.12+

## Variables

Name   |   Description   |   Default  
--- | --- | --- 
**gcp_project_id** | Target GCP Project ID | None 
**gcp_credentials** | Path to the GCP Service Account json key file | None 
**zone** | GCP Zone to deploy into [ref](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/regions-zones/) | us-central1-a 
**region** | GCP Region to deploy into [ref](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/regions-zones/) | us-central1 
**bootstrap_bucket** | Name to use for the bootstrap bucket | None 
**bootstrap_bucket_admin** | Email of the GCS Bucket Admin | None 
**bootstrap_folders**  | These folders are required to bootstrap PAN devices, do not change | ["config/", "software/", "license/", "content/"] 
**pan_fw_image** | URL to PAN Image to use or name of image if published to GCR for the project identified in gcp_project_id | None 
**management_ip** | Management IP for the device interface | None 
**untrust_ip**    | Untrust IP for the device interface | None 
**trust_ip_web**  | Trust IP for the device interface for web traffic | None 
**trust_ip_db**   | Trust IP for the device interface for DB traffic | None 
**pan_int_0_name** | Interface name for the Management interface | None 
**pan_int_1_name** | Interface name for the Untrust interface | None 
**pan_int_0_name** | Interface name for the Trust interface | None 
**pan_int_0_name** | Interface name for the Management interface | None 
**pan_machine_type** | Machine type for PAN Devices | n1-standard-4 
**pan_cpu** | CPU for the PAN Device | Intel Skylake 
**pan_scopes** | API Scopes for the PAN Device | "cloud.useraccounts.readonly", "devstorage.read_only", "logging.write", "monitoring.write" 

## Recommendations

Given the variable nature of the PAN configurations, it is recommended to leverage a minimum acceptable config for bootstrap.xml populated into the /config bootstrap folder and apply the working policy upon completion of bootstrapping. The included boostrap.xml will apply a configuration for a 3 tier web app consisting of a Web network (trust), DB network (trust), Management network and an Untrust network. An alternate approach to a static bootstrap file would be to leverage jinja templates and populate variables accordingly. 

Login configured in this bootstrap.xml file: paloalto / Pal0Alt0@123 . **Do not use this for production**

## Usage

1) Set up **terraform.tfvars**  with appropriate values for your project
2) ```terraform init```
3) ```terraform apply```

The device can take a few minutes to boot and be available on the public IP assigned.

*Note:* it is assumed you already have a GCP project and Service Account created.

**Final note:**  there is no authcode file included. This demo will bring the device online, but it will not pass traffic until a valid license has been applied.
